# Alcohol vs. Hangover - DDM in R
This project was part of the course "Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making" within the psychology research master 'Cognitive Neuroscience' at Leiden University. The final paper and research poster can also be found under documents.

## Usage
This repository **includes all raw data and code** used to visualize the data _(data_visualization.R)_, inspect differences in reaction time and accuracy between the two conditions _(data_inspection.R)_, and finally fitting the Drift Diffusion Model _(model_fitting.R)_. Model fitting was done using the function _fit_model()_ that can be found in the _"helper_functions.R"_ code.

All analyses were performed in R Version 2024.04.1+748 (2024.04.1+748).
